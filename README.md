# How to Launch the Game

To start the game, choose one option:

**Using the Executable File (Windows only):**
   - Click on the `.exe` file to launch the game.
   - **Important:** Do not move the `.exe` file from its original folder, as this may cause errors.
     
**Using the Python Script:**
   - If you prefer to run the game through the source code, ensure you have python, then run : `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Once the requirements are set up, run the command `python main.py` and enjoy the game !
