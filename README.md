# FreeDiving Game

## Description 
The FreeDiving Game is a realistic freediving simulation game that puts you in the fins of an apnea diver. Master your breath, manage your energy, and explore the depths through two distinct gameplay modes, both emphasizing realism and strategy:

#### Play Mode (Real Apnea Challenge):
- **Your Breath is the Timer**: Experience true freediving immersion. There's no in-game oxygen bar: your real-life breath hold is the clock.

- **Control** the Descent: Press **Enter to kick** your fins and dive deeper.

- Initiate Ascent: Press the **Spacebar to turn around** and start your crucial ascent back to the surface.

- The Ultimate Test: After surfacing, the game asks the vital question: "Did You Succeed?" Your real-world ability to hold your breath until safely surfacing determines your success. 

#### Explore Mode (Focus on Discovery):
- **Virtual** Oxygen Management: Focus on exploration and technique. An oxygen bar gradually depletes as you dive, removing the need for real-world breath-holding.

- Same Core Controls: Use Enter to fin downwards and Spacebar to turn and ascend, just like in Play Mode.

#### Key Realistic Mechanics for Both Modes:
- **Limited Energy**, Critical Choice: You only have 30 fin kicks worth of energy per dive! Use them wisely.
- Strategic **Depth Management**: Don't linger too deep – running out of energy at depth is dangerous!
- **Master Negative Buoyancy**: Experience a crucial real-world freediving phenomenon. At around 20 meters (65 feet), your character becomes negatively buoyant and starts to sink effortlessly. Use this to conserve precious fin kicks on your descent, just like professional freedivers do.




## How to Launch the Game

To start the game, choose one option:

**Using the Executable File (Windows only):**
